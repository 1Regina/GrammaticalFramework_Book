Commands run after 
* <<FOOD>>  << Chapter 02>>
1. i foodsEng.cf or foodsIta.cf or foodsChi.cf
   1. gr
   2. gt
   3. l Pred (This Cheese) Expensive
   4. parse "questo formaggio `e caro"
   5. linearize Pred (This Cheese) Expensive
   6. gr -number=4 | l
   7. gt | l  or gt -depth=3 | l
   8. l Pred (This Cheese) Juicy (NEED TO TWEAK?)
2. i FoodEng.gf FoodIta.gf
   1. p -lang=Ita "quel pesce `e molto caro" | l -lang=Eng
   2. p -lang=Eng "this wine is Italian" | l -lang=Ita  
   3. gt -number=4 | l 
   4. gr -number=4 | l 
   5. linearize Pred (This Cheese) Expensive
   6. gr Pred (This ?) Italian
   7. gr Pred (This ?) Italian | l
   8. gr -number=3 This ?
   9. (-depth=x) is for depth within the bracket
   10. gr -depth=2 -number=2
   11. gt -depth=2 -number=2 Pred (This ?) ?
   12. gt -depth=2 -number=2 Pred (This ?) ?|l
   13. gt -depth=1 Pred ? ?
   14. gt -depth=0 Pred (This (Mod ? ?)) ? | l -treebank
3. after negative predication ex 2.7
   1. gr NPred (This ?) ? | l

4. P60 "it"  Pronoun but need an external program to dictate when to use it
   parse "it is very expensive" after adding to abstract and FoodEng
   fun Pron : Item -> Item
   lin Pron r = "it"
   Choose language by ```parse -lang=Eng "it is very expensive" ```  otherwise ```parse "it is very expensive"```

6. Ex 2.8 use ComplexKind and Kind2C for FoodEng for unambiguous; and FoodsIta With
   1. l Pred (This (Kind2C Cheese)) Expensive
   2. l NPred (This (Kind2C Cheese)) Expensive
   3. gr NPred (This (With ? ?)) Expensive| l
   4. gr NPred (That (With ? ?)) ?| l
   5. parse "this wine with warm cheese is very boring"
   6. gr Pred (This (With Wine (Kind2C (Mod Warm Cheese)))) (Very Boring)| l
   7. gr Pred (This (With ? (Kind2C (Mod ? ?)))) (Very ?)| l

7. Ex 2.6 ticket
   1. ```gr -number=3 | l -table``` to show all the permutation of sentence 
   2. ```gr -number=3```

8. use a script in terminal outside of gf with ```gf < FoodScript.gfs```

* << Inflection table, param and ope>> << Chapter 03>>
1. Ex 3.1
   1.  ```i -retain BooleanE3.gf``` Using i -retain bcos we are using param and oper
   2.  ```cc ConDisjunct ! True ! True``` NB: ```!``` bcos we are using    a table so need to select input argument
   3.  ```cc ConDisjunctStr ! True ! True```
   4.  ```cc ConDisjuncStrSugarTbl ! True! True```
   5.  ``` cc ConDisjuncBoolSugarTbl ! False ! True ```
2. Ex 3.2
   test inflection table with param and oper
   1.  ```i -retain FoodsEng.gf```  then ```compute_concrete (regNoun "wine").s ! Pl```
   2.  ```compute_concrete (noun "fish" "fish").ÃŸs ! Pl```
   3.  ```cc flynoun "fly"``` to see the transformation
   4.  ```l -table Wine```
   5.  gf F
3. Ex 3.3 DiscontEng.gf need help on ap and wp table ->  See comments in DiscontEng and Discont. 
   1. DiscontEng
      1. Dont need DeclCW and QuestClW bcos now CompAP and CompAPW output a VP which will be arguments for DeclCl and QuestCl.
      2. Added vp.when to SDecl and SQuest for PredVP np vp
      3. Note the difference between CompAP vs CompAPW regarding when
   2. Discont : Add Now, Already and CompAPW
   3. Run ```  gr DeclCl (PredVP John (CompAPW ? ? ))```
4. Cannot i FoodsIta.gf even though they are copied from textbook.
5. Can we walk thru the oper meaning in ResIta.gf. P90. Dont understand why (nero,nera,neri,nere : Str) -> Adjective =  can be wildcard since they are used again.
6. desugar of Very qual in FoodsIta. correct?
7. <Ch04>
8. how should i read ResEng.gf oper det
9.  resEng Mth 1 and Mth 2 correct and concept
10. do i need to ensure the same oper name exist for ResEng and ResIta?
11. resEng : what does the w and ws in regNoun stand for. LHS or RHS? 
12. With resource FoodEng, why do i still need a abstract Food ..comparing agst BooleanE3
13. See regNounNomGen for complex Noun in ResEng.gf Should it be 2 or 3 arguments < Str -> Str -> Str -> regNounNomGen
14. Is my case expression in table for allVerb in ResEng.gf correct? if yes, i can get rid of regVerb correct?
15. UmlautE4 syntax error
16. OverloadEng - need to take care of all 5 scenarios in irregVerb for PresentPl altho no modification eg sing -> sing since  "in worstCaseVerb sings sing singing sang sung ;" last line has 5 arguments.    
17. OverloadEng - syntax error  
18. Commands to run to get dependency graph to show module structures
    1.  i -retain Shopping.gf
    2.  dependency_graph   << or use dg for abbreviation >> 
    3.  ! dot -Tpng _gfdepgraph.dot >diamond.png
19. more question : p108 4.14 prefix oper in OverloadEng pre { } why the yellow syntax colour comes on is bcos pre { } is missing type with case pre of  etc
20. Notes: p109 Tokens can be created in the following ways: 
    1.  quoted string; "foo"
    2.  gluing: t + s
    3.  predefiined operations: init, tail, tk, dp
    4.  pattern matching over strings: "y" => "ies"
    5.  prefix-dependent choices: pre { ..}
21.<Ch05>
   1. Read again of the Resource Grammar Library at S5.4 p115, 116 for notes.
   2. ? Should FoodsRGLEng be linked with Ch04 ResEng.gf
   3. Ex 5.0 Commands to run
      1. gr
      2. gr Pred ? ? |l
      3. gr That ? |l
      4. gr Mod ? ?
      5. gr Mod
      6. gt | l -treebank
